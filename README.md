# Pokematch

An overengineered pokemon memory game

![Pokematch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikowl/pokematch/main/screenshots.png)

  - MVP:
	1. ~~Create function that grabs 8 random pokemon from pokeapi~~
	2. ~~Take the 8, double them, then shuffle~~
	3. ~~Display in nice 4x4 grid~~
	3. ~~Flip animation and matching logic~~
	4. ~~Keep track of guesses~~
	5. ~~Confetti when you win~~
	6. ~~Restart game and generate new set of random pokemons~~

- TODO maybe
  - ~~Next game will move on to next pokemon generation~~
  - ~~Different card backings per generation~~
  - ~~Sounds~~
  - ~~Different difficulties~~
  - ~~Mute button~~
  - ~~End game screen for passing gen 9~~
  - ~~Local storage to save current level and mute state~~
  - ~~Powerups~~
  - ~~Since introducing the pokemon battle after round we can probably get rid of the "Next" game button and instead progress to the next round after choosing, I think this will be a better ux~~
  - Improve "game over" screen

- Powerup ideas
  - Time freeze
  - Double points
  - Free turns (take away 2 turns)
  - Hint (flip over one matching pair)
  - "Milk" the reveal powerup, give user 3 chances to choose the winning pokemon, based on how good they do, the reveal will be longer or shorter
